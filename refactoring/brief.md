# Refactoring to use async/await

## Task

In **pairs**, upgrade the following to use async/await (where appropriate):

* [consumer-contracts](https://github.com/bbc/consumer-contracts)
* [sqs-consumer](https://github.com/bbc/sqs-consumer)
* [sqs-producer](https://github.com/bbc/sqs-producer)
* [ibl-programmes-client](https://github.com/bbc/ibl-programmes-client)
* [iplayer-web-rest-client](https://github.com/bbc/iplayer-web-rest-client)
* [http-transport-statsd](https://github.com/bbc/http-transport-statsd)
* [http-transport-rate-limiter](https://github.com/bbc/http-transport-rate-limiter)

You can treat the above as a dev exercise or make an official contribution (see contribution guidelines for the project).

Alternatively, select an appropriate iplayer component you maintain.
